# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project serves as a basic study guide template for students in a coding bootcamp. It shall serve as a backbone to all their coding notes so less time  is spent scouring past-modules, webpages, or textbooks and more time applying those new skills.

Study guides tend to be cluttered with excessive details with complex formatting making it hard for students to use it as a go-to reference whenever a quick recall is needed. This defeats its purpose and you would do better grabbing the textbook, which will also not be efficient for a quick reference.

The prework study guide will allow students to cut down the time to reference and generate more time learning how to actively apply them. 

If used throughout the course, concisely updating it with new notes after each class, easy to read and located, one should find themselves having no trouble keeping up with the pace of the course curriculum.
